# xkcd 1446 - Landing

![GIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MagicalTux/xkcd1446/master/img/GIFs/1hz.gif)

Small script to download and display images from http://xkcd.com/1446/

This is live on URL: http://xkcd1446.org/

GIFs (Most of them, fortunately, are slower than the one above.) are available [here](https://github.com/MagicalTux/xkcd1446/tree/master/img/GIFs).

# TODO

- Anything that is on http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ (that project was a bit too big to download and adapt, making a fully clientside solution that would only rely on a couple of api would be better, I guess).
- Make archive link?
