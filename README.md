# xkcd 1446 - ???

Small script to download and display images from http://xkcd.com/1446/

This is live on URL: http://xkcd1446.org/

# TODO

- Anything that is on http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/ (that project was a bit too big to download and adapt, making a fully clientside solution that would only rely on a couple of api would be better, I guess).
- Generate animated gif?
- Make archive link?
